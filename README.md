Title of presentation:  Fragile Families
start time: 2:39
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
did you use any R packages built for surveys?
Thesis: how are you going to argue about "most significant"?  definitely didn't support this.
What is the cross validated MSE? Is it actually predictive?
dummy variables?
year's not analyzed!  excellent way to make new features.
should know how many beta's used!  should report these to support your thesis!  


comment to class:
fill NA with mean and make new feature!




Title of presentation:  Mass shootings
start time 3:07
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:  
The visualizations are great. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
plot 17 lines; January - Dec. 
argument for shootings -> purchases is weak.  
slide 12 is too much.  story not clear.
thesis is a bit causal...
residual plot doesn't explore anything.
fixed effects for states!
fixed effects for months!  




Title of presentation:  voting 
3:48


What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
interesting question!
new features?

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
"most significant" is not well defined. 
disparity by county is super interesting (feasible?);  do some states over report.  can you get turnout by state?
include state dummies or state lat/long.
Yini suggests: american national election studies




Title of presentation: yelp in Las Vegas
4:16

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
lots of cool data.  directed in pursuit of data.  

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
clarify (lowess - then factors)???





Title of presentation: crime
4:40

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
thesis statement should make a claim, not describe "what you did"
data set exploring... no need to grid!  Is this a good resolution? 
restaurants don't change over time???
add confidence intervals to lines "crime count per day per block"
predicted vs truth  should have their own axis!
"significance" is both scientific and statistical. 
why include mean of predicted? 




Title of presentation:  League of legend

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:  fun data source!

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

why was some data missing?  What subset of the data are you talking about?  How does this confine your conclusions.

I don't understand what you are doing.  It is an entire blackbox.  You are presenting numbers and not describing what they mean.  Please make sure that your final report is clear about what numbers mean.  

You describe "most of the papers"... please cite these papers in the literature.

Why 10*29 variables? 

what are your conclusions?




Title of presentation:  H1B

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:  

cool data.  cool question.  nice combination.  



What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

is boosting cross validated???

Random forest also reduces bias....   

radar plot sensitive to variable ordering. 

dem is not highcertified... just high.  
why is boosting 2x? 


what is outcome?  what are features?  count? proportion? 

cluster results are hard to interpret....
could output of k-means results be used to reformulate a regression problem?
   this is often easier to interpret.










Title of presentation:  Traffic 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

Cool combination of several data sets. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

What is a natural model of variation from one year to the next?

infrastructure spending has a big lag...

Does thesis statement only study marginal correlation? 

"significant" in conclusions... be careful.

add jitter (year vs residual)

easier to intrepte R^2 compared to resid&null deviance. 






Title of presentation:   Songs

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

super fun topic!


What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

thesis needs to be stronger.  not "may be" but "are"
why the bubble in word counts?
define entropy.  
whose definition of sentiment? 
smooth the lines that are too bumpy
give citations to outside sources!  this is what makes it impressive!
are you taking another definition of rhyming?
  - if not, need to validated this definition!!!
need to focus attention of slides... don't need to talk about everything.
overplotting
entropy vs rhyme... add smoothing line.









Title of presentation:  NBA

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:   

really cool data!

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
careful that the project holds together as one whole. 
Is motion changnign statistically significant??
  -  I would look at r in radians and make a histogram. "shot zone range"
who are hall of famers? what years??
what is the expected value of a shot?
instead of counts of shots... might be more interesting to look at # points scored by xxxx-shot.






Title of presentation:  Global terrorism

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:  
really nice slide with columns of variabels id/ incident /location /...
clearly channeling hans rosling!!

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

count is confounded by our "intensity of looking/definition"
thesis is entirely discounted by the limitation... there is nothing left.
