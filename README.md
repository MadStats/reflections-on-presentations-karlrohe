Title of presentation:  Fragile Families
start time: 2:39
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
did you use any R packages built for surveys?
Thesis: how are you going to argue about "most significant"?  definitely didn't support this.
What is the cross validated MSE? Is it actually predictive?
dummy variables?
year's not analyzed!  excellent way to make new features.
should know how many beta's used!  should report these to support your thesis!  


comment to class:
fill NA with mean and make new feature!




Title of presentation:  Mass shootings
start time 3:07
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:  
The visualizations are great. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
plot 17 lines; January - Dec. 
argument for shootings -> purchases is weak.  
slide 12 is too much.  story not clear.
thesis is a bit causal...
residual plot doesn't explore anything.
fixed effects for states!
fixed effects for months!  




Title of presentation:  voting 
3:48

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
interesting question!
new features?

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
"most significant" is not well defined. 
disparity by county is super interesting (feasible?);  do some states over report.  can you get turnout by state?
include state dummies or state lat/long.
Yini suggests: american national election studies




Title of presentation: yelp in Las Vegas
4:16

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
lots of cool data.  directed in pursuit of data.

clarify (lowess - then factors)???





Title of presentation: crime
4:40

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
thesis statement should make a claim, not describe "what you did"
data set exploring... no need to grid!  Is this a good resolution? 
restaurants don't change over time???
add confidence intervals to lines "crime count per day per block"
predicted vs truth  should have their own axis!
"significance" is both scientific and statistical. 
why include mean of predicted?
